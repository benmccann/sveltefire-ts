# SvelteFireTS

- SvelteKit 
- Typescript
- Firebase 9 beta
- *includes FirebaseUI web + Firebase 8 brought in via CDN only when login modal is opened - FirebaseUI web allows for easy authentication in dozens of languages and many providers without you need to manage the authentication forms - this will be upgraded to use Firebase 9 once it goes GA*

## Inspiration: Fireship.io

Jeff Delaney gets most of the credit for SvelteFireTS. I started with https://github.com/codediodeio/sveltefire then added Typescript and borrowed some convenient helpers from [Firestore Advanced Usage Angularfire](https://fireship.io/lessons/firestore-advanced-usage-angularfire/). Please sign up at Fireship.io and subscribe to the [Fireship Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) for some great tutorials.


## Todo
I'm using this in production and will shortly share an axample application using SvelteFireTS.

## Firebase 9 Usage Examples

See https://modularfirebase.web.app/common-use-cases/firestore/ for good docs on Firebase 9 use cases (though it's documentation for the Alpha and is possibly out-dated now, it's much more useful than the main Firebase docs for quickly finding use cases)
