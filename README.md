- SvelteKit 
- Typescript
- Firebase 9 beta
- *includes FirebaseUI web + Firebase 8 brought in via CDN only when login modal is opened - FirebaseUI web allows for easy authentication in dozens of languages and many providers without you need to manage the authentication forms - this will be upgraded to use Firebase 9 once it goes GA*

Jeff Delaney gets most of the credit for SvelteFireTS. I started with https://github.com/codediodeio/sveltefire then added Typescript and borrowed some convenient helpers from [Firestore Advanced Usage Angularfire](https://fireship.io/lessons/firestore-advanced-usage-angularfire/).
